## Presentation

Hi, I'm Telami, an 18th years old man who wrote java code for almost 5 years now.<br>

## Programmer Thougths

I learned the basic syntaxes and various features and characteristics of many other languages, 
but I can't truly say that I can wrote good quality code with them.<br>
I don't like to say that I know a language only because I know few things, and, few things 
could mean a lot for others.<br>
So, I mainly focused on 1 language (Java) to achieve almost the entire knowledge of it!<br>
With that I learned a lot about architectures and other stuff that I think someone MUST know
for writing good code, for examples the basics are: memory hierarchy, unordered buffer, 
multi-thread computing, memory order and so on.<br>
I don't rely on AI and this could be a good and a bad thing, thus I tolerate who use it for
studying new things, I don't never let it touch my code.<br>

## Projects

That being said, I'm currently... (I will complete this README as soon is possible!)
