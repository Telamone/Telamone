## üëã Presentation

Hi, I'm <b>Telami</b>, a 19 years old guy who wrote <b>java</b> code for almost <b>6 years</b>.<br>

## üí≠ Programmer Thougths

I learned the basic syntaxes, various features and characteristics of many <b>other languages</b>, 
but I <b>can't</b> truly say that I can write <b>good quality code</b> with them.<br>
I <b>don't like</b> to say that I know a language only because I know <b>few things</b>, and, few things 
could mean <b>a lot</b> for others.<br>
So, I mainly focused on 1 language (Java) to achieve <b>almost the entire knowledge</b> of it!<br>
With that I learned a lot about <b>architectures and other stuff</b> that I think someone MUST know
for writing good code, for examples the basics are: <i>memory hierarchy</i>, <i>unordered buffer</i>, 
<i>multi-thread computing</i>, <i>memory order</i> and so on.<br>
I <b>don't rely</b> on <b>AI</b> and this could be a good and a bad thing, thus I <b>tolerate</b> who use it for
<b>studying</b> new things, I don't never let it touch my code.<br>

## üíª Projects

That being said, I'm currently developing <b>privately</b> minecraft plugins for profit and an
entire <b>utility lib</b> as an hobby.<br>
My intention is to base all my <b>future premium works</b> on that lib, considering the amount of
<b>effort</b> I'm putting in it.<br>
Additionally, that lib offers many API that anyone could <b>use in the future</b> for <b>free</b> or 
under a <b>license</b>.<br>
Currently the lib is <b>mutating</b>, but I'm working on <b>stabilizing</b> the various
API, <b>severely testing</b> them in both <i>common</i> and <i>edge</i> cases for achieving the <b>perfect stability</b>
with <b>good performances</b>.<br>
I would <b>never</b> write an API that performs <b>worst</b> than the actual existing ones, because it's 
<b>useless</b> since nobody would use it;
I <b>already erased</b> many implementations because they performed <b>poorly</b>.<br>
But that is a good thing too: the <b>time</b> and the <b>experience</b> teach us how to <b>improve</b>.<br>

## ‚òéÔ∏è Availability

Actually I'm <b>not</b> open to <i>work requests</i>, but, if I am <b>free</b>, I always enjoy earing other's
<b>opinion about programming</b> in general.
